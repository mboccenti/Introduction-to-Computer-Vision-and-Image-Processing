# Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing
Computer Vision and Image Processing

Computer Vision is one of the most exciting fields in Machine Learning and AI. It has applications in many industries, such as self-driving cars, robotics, augmented reality, and much more. In this beginner-friendly course, you will understand computer vision and learn about its various applications across many industries.

As part of this course, you will utilize Python, Pillow, and OpenCV for basic image processing and perform image classification and object detection.

This is a hands-on course and involves several labs and exercises. Labs will combine Jupyter Labs and Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio), a free learning tool for computer vision. CV Studio allows you to upload, train, and test your own custom image classifier and detection models.  At the end of the course, you will create your own computer vision web app and deploy it to the Cloud.

This course does not require any prior Machine Learning or Computer Vision experience. However, some knowledge of the Python programming language and high school math is necessary.
